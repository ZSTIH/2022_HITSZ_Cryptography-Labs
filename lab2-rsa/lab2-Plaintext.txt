2002 A.M. TURING AWARD. RSA, an acronym for Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, uses algorithmic number theory to provide an efficient realization of a public-key cryptosystem, a concept first envisioned theoretically by Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle. RSA is now the most widely used encryption method, with applications throughout the Internet to secure on-line transactions. It has also inspired breakthrough work in both theoretical computer science and mathematics.
